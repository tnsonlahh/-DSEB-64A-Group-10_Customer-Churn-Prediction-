 Algorithms: Decision Tree
 Variables can include: service usage time, number of complaints, satisfaction level.
 Steps to implement:
 - Collect and clean customer data.
 - Create feature variables related to customer behavior.
 - Train the Decision Tree model to classify customers who are likely to churn.

 (In consideration) Add Online Behavior: Incorporate more data from customer behavior on online platforms such as number of visits, time on site, and interaction with content. This behavioral data will help increase the accuracy of churn prediction.
 (In consideration) Combine with Sentiment Analysis: Integrate sentiment analysis from customer reviews or social media feedback to improve predictions. if you want to follow NLP
- For example: Use a sentiment analysis model (VnCoreNLP or transformers-based models like BERT) to assess customer satisfaction and sentiment, then integrate it into the churn prediction model.
